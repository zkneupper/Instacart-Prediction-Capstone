The dataset contains over 3 million anonymized grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.  The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017), and a description of the tables and variables in the dataset can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/jeremystan/c3b39d947d9b88b3ccff3147dbcf6c6b)."
