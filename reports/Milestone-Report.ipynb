    "#### Our Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "Last year, Instacart released a public dataset, “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”.  The dataset contains over 3 million anonymized grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users.  We use this dataset in our analysis.  The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017)\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The Instacart dataset contains six tables in `.csv` format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `aisles.csv`\n",
    "2. `deptartments.csv`\n",
    "3. `order_products__prior.csv`\n",
    "4. `order_products__train.csv`\n",
    "5. `orders.csv`\n",
    "6. `products.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "A more detailed description of these tables is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`orders` (3.4m rows, 206k users):\n",
    "* `order_id`: order identifier\n",
    "* `user_id`: customer identifier\n",
    "* `eval_set`: which evaluation set this order belongs in (see `SET` described below)\n",
    "* `order_number`: the order sequence number for this user (1 = first, n = nth)\n",
    "* `order_dow`: the day of the week the order was placed on\n",
    "* `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of the day the order was placed on\n",
    "* `days_since_prior`: days since the last order, capped at 30 (with NAs for `order_number` = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "`products` (50k rows):\n",
    "* `product_id`: product identifier\n",
    "* `product_name`: name of the product\n",
    "* `aisle_id`: foreign key\n",
    "* `department_id`: foreign key\n",
    "\n",
    "`aisles` (134 rows):\n",
    "* `aisle_id`: aisle identifier\n",
    "* `aisle`: the name of the aisle\n",
    "\n",
    "`deptartments` (21 rows):\n",
    "* `department_id`: department identifier\n",
    "* `department`: the name of the department\n",
    "\n",
    "`order_products__SET` (30m+ rows):\n",
    "* `order_id`: foreign key\n",
    "* `product_id`: foreign key\n",
    "* `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added to cart\n",
    "* `reordered`: 1 if this product has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise\n",
    "\n",
    "where `SET` is one of the four following evaluation sets (`eval_set` in `orders`):\n",
    "* `\"prior\"`: orders prior to that users most recent order (~3.2m orders)\n",
    "* `\"train\"`: training data supplied to participants (~131k orders)\n",
    "* `\"test\"`: test data reserved for machine learning competitions (~75k orders)\n",

    "#### Data Wrangling & Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step in wrangling the Instacart dataset was to take the contents of the six  `.csv` files and store them in one SQLite database.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then used SQL to transform the dataset to create a new table that we could use to train and test our machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Index\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a list of unique pairs of users and products from the `prior` set of orders.  We gave this list the label \"`up_pair`\" for \"user-product pair\".  This list list was used as a unique index of our final data table.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Target\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a binary target variable `y` for whether or not a user reordered a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each unique pair of user and product from the `prior` set of orders, if the user bought the product in the  `prior` set of orders *and* reordered the product in the `train` set of orders, then our target variable `y` is assigned the value 1.  On the other hand, if the user bought the product in the  `prior` set, but they didn't reorder the product in the `train` set, then our target variable `y` is assigned the value 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The Features\n",
    "\n",
    "We engineered five explanatory features.  These features are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the user-product pair of (User A, Product B),\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `total_buy_n5`: the total number of times User A bought Product B out of the 5 most recent orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `total_buy_ratio_n5`: the proportion of User A's 5 most recent orders in which User A bought Product B.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `order_ratio_by_chance_n5`: the proportion of User A's 5 most recent orders in which User A had the \"chance\" to buy B, and did indeed do so.  Here, a \"chance\" refers to the number of opportunities the user had for buying the item after first encountering (*viz.*, buying)  it. For example, if a User A bought Product B for the first time in their 4th most recent order, then the user would have had 4 chances to buy the product.  If that user had bought the product only in their 4th and 2nd most recent orders, then `order_ratio_by_chance_n5` would be 0.5 (*i.e., (1+1)/4) for that user-product pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `useritem_order_days_max_n5`: the longest number of days that User A has recently gone without buying Product B.  We are only considering the 5 most recent orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `useritem_order_days_min_n5`: the shortest number of days that User A has recently gone without buying Product B.  Again, we are only considering the 5 most recent orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of these five features was inspired by [Onodera's solution](http://blog.kaggle.com/2017/09/21/instacart-market-basket-analysis-winners-interview-2nd-place-kazuki-onodera/]), which won 2nd place in the Instacart Kaggle competition."
