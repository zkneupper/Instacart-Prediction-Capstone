This repo contains the documentation for my second capstone project at [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/workshops/data-science-career-track).  The goal of this capstone project is to use machine learning techniques to predict the consumer behavior of Instacart shoppers.


My analysis is based on “The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017”, accessed from https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017 on June 25, 2017.  This is an open sourced dataset of 3 million Instacart orders.
